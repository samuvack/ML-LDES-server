The Machine Learning (ML) server for Linked Data Event Streams (LDES) is a configurable component that can be used to ingest LDES, whereafter a machine learning model can be unleashed on it. The ML-LDES server was built in the context of the VSDS project in order to easily predict, analyse, find relationships, etc. with the use of ML.

## Quick start
First, you need the run the following command. This will install the required python packages:
```

```
Second, you need to start docker. You can do this by the following command (first open docker desktop in admin mode):
